INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY

DAVID walks into the school, and there are already groups of people talking together. JANE and HARRY walk up to him.


JANE

Hi, you're David right? I recognize you from your picture on the Slack channel!


DAVID

Yes, indeed. Jane and Harry, right? Have you guys been here long.


HARRY

We just arrived. I think everybody did, really.


DAVID

Perfect, let's go meet the other people!




INT. HOLBERTON SCHOOL OPEN SPACE - DAY

DAVID is now with AMY, they're working in pair to move forward on the Git project.


AMY

Have you ever used Git?


DAVID

I heard of it, but never used it. I did use SVN in a group project I did in college though. How about you?


AMY

I actually used Git when I built a website for my chess club. But I was the only one doing the project, so I barely scratched the surface.


DAVID

Oh, we'll definitely be able to learn from each other then!


AMY

Sounds like it!


FADE OUT.
